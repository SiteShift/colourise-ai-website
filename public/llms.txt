## What is ColouriseAI?

ColouriseAI is an AI-powered mobile application for iOS and Android that transforms black and white photographs into full-color images. Using deep learning neural networks trained on millions of color photographs, ColouriseAI predicts and applies contextually appropriate colors to grayscale images.

## Key Features

- **AI Photo Colorization**: Transform any black and white or sepia photo to color in seconds
- **Face Enhancement**: Restore and enhance facial details in old photographs
- **4K Upscaling**: Increase image resolution up to 4K quality
- **Fast Processing**: Results typically generated in 3-8 seconds
- **Privacy-Focused**: Photos are processed securely and not stored permanently

## How It Works

1. User uploads a black and white or grayscale photograph
2. AI analyzes the image content (faces, objects, landscapes, clothing)
3. Neural network predicts appropriate colors based on context
4. Colorized image is generated and returned to user

## Use Cases

- Colorizing old family photographs
- Genealogy and family history research
- Historical photo restoration
- Educational purposes
- Creative projects

## Important Notes

- AI colorization is an interpretation, not a historically accurate reconstruction
- Results are predictions based on learned patterns
- Original colors cannot be determined with certainty
- Works best with high-contrast, well-lit photographs

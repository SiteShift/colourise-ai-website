## 👤 Author Persona Blueprint

| Attribute | Recommendation | SEO / EEAT Reason |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Name** | **Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Grant** | Distinct, no SERP collisions |
| **Title** | Founder & Chief Imaging Scientist, ColorizeAI | Signals authority + hands-on experience |
| **Credentials** | • PhD Computer Vision (UCL) <br>• Former Digital Preservation Lead, British Library <br>• Published in *CVPR*, *Digital Humanities Quarterly* | Hard credentials → Experience + Expertise |
| **Back-Story Hook** | Digitised 250k WWII negatives with AI during PhD; founded ColorizeAI after watching families cry over first color reveals. | Emotional narrative, StoryBrand positioning |
| **Tone Guidelines** | • Conversational yet data-driven <br>• "We" for team, "you" for reader <br>• Minimal jargon (define terms in-line) | Balances clarity & authority |
| **Author Schema Mark-up** | `@type:"Person"` → `name`, `sameAs` (LinkedIn, ORCID), `affiliation`, `knowsAbout` (photo colorization, computer vision, digital preservation) | Boosts rich-result trust signals |

### 🎯 **SILO-SPECIFIC EXPERTISE POSITIONING**

**Dr. Grant's Authority Varies by Content Silo** (for topical authority):

| Content Silo | Dr. Grant's Positioning | Example Opening |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Fundamentals & Technical** | Algorithm Developer & Researcher | "As someone who developed colorization algorithms during my PhD..." |
| **Photo Restoration** | Digital Preservation Expert | "From my years leading digital preservation at the British Library..." |
| **Family & Genealogy** | Memory Preservation Advocate | "I've watched thousands of families reconnect with their heritage..." |
| **Historical & Educational** | Academic Researcher & Archivist | "Working with historical collections taught me that accuracy matters..." |
| **Tool Comparisons** | Industry Analyst & Lab Tester | "Having tested every major colorization tool in our research lab..." |
| **Professional Applications** | Business Consultant & Technical Advisor | "When consulting for museums and institutions, I've learned..." |

**Usage Rule**: Each article MUST include one silo-appropriate Dr. Grant positioning statement within the first 200 words.

## 🛑 Why Fixed Templates Can Backfire

Google's 2025 Helpful-Content system detects boiler-plate footprints.  
If every post = **Pain → Agitate → Mechanism → Proof → CTA**, rankings stall.

### Non-Negotiable SEO Elements (must appear)

- Keyword in H1 + meta-title  
- Search-intent match in first 100 words  
- Helpful sub-heads (H2/H3)  
- Visual proof block (before/after slider)  
- Schema (FAQ, HowTo, ImageObject)  
- Internal links → pillar page **and** product page
- **MANDATORY APP DOWNLOAD CTA** (see conversion strategy below)

### Flexible Elements (rotate or shuffle)

| Variation Axis | Options |
|----------------|---------|
| **Lead Style** | Story · Problem-Solution · Statistic/News · Offer · Secret/Mechanism · proclamation |
| **Hook Device** | Mini-anecdote · surprising stat · direct question |
| **Proof Type** | Testimonial · case-study GIF · lab result |
| **CTA Copy** | "Download ColorizeAI Free" · "Get ColorizeAI on App Store" · "Try ColorizeAI - Download Now" |
| **Urgency Device** | Limited free credits · "Join 2M+ users" · "Featured App of the Day" |

Use this list as a **pre-flight inspection**, not a paragraph-by-paragraph script.

## 📱 **CRITICAL: MOBILE APP DOWNLOAD CONVERSION STRATEGY**

### **🎯 PRIMARY CONVERSION GOAL: APP DOWNLOADS ONLY**

**Every article MUST drive to mobile app download - this is the ONLY conversion goal.**

#### **Universal CTA Requirements:**
- **Placement**: Minimum 2 CTAs per article (mid-content + end)
- **Target**: App Store + Google Play Store downloads
- **Tracking**: Include UTM parameters for blog attribution
- **Design**: App store badges + compelling copy

#### **CTA Copy Variations** (rotate to prevent patterns):

| CTA Style | Example Copy | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Benefit-Focused** | "Transform your family photos in seconds - Download ColorizeAI Free" | Emotional content (family, memories) |
| **Feature-Focused** | "Get AI-powered colorization on your phone - Download ColorizeAI" | Technical content (how-to, comparisons) |
| **Social Proof** | "Join 2M+ users bringing photos to life - Download ColorizeAI" | Authority content (reviews, case studies) |
| **Urgency** | "Download ColorizeAI now - First 5 photos FREE" | Time-sensitive content (news, trends) |
| **Problem-Solution** | "Stop struggling with complicated software - Download ColorizeAI" | Problem-focused content (pain points) |

#### **CTA Placement Strategy:**
1. **Mid-Article CTA** (after problem/benefit section): Soft introduction to app
2. **End-Article CTA** (final call): Strong conversion push with urgency
3. **Sidebar CTA** (optional): Persistent visibility during scroll

#### **App Store Badge Requirements:**
- Always include BOTH App Store + Google Play badges
- Use official store badges (not custom designs)
- Include "Download on" + "Get it on" official text
- Link directly to app store pages with UTM tracking

## 🔄 How to Program Cursor for Unique-yet-Optimized Posts

```jsonc
// 1. Randomize lead style + silo positioning
{ 
  "lead_type": ["Story", "Problem-Solution", "Statistic News"],
  "authority_positioning": "silo_specific_dr_grant_intro"
}

// 2. Mandatory app download CTAs
{% if word_count > 800 %}
  {{ include 'mid_article_app_cta' }}
{% endif %}
{{ include 'end_article_app_cta' }}

// 3. Inject dynamic tokens
Processing time: {{processing_time_ms}} ms  
Color accuracy: {{color_accuracy_pct}} %
App downloads: {{total_downloads}} users
Content-block library: store 30 proof blocks (testimonials, citations). Select randomly.

Depth & Tone sliders: {{depth}} (1–3), {{tone}} (warm ↔ analytical) to vary diction.
```
